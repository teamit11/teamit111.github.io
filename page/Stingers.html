                Among arthropods, a sting or stinger is a sharp organ, <br>often connected with a venom<br> gland and

                inflict a wound by piercing, <br> Roften connected with a venom gland <br>and adapted to inflict a wound
                by
                piercing,<br> as with the caudal sting of a
                scorpion.

            <h4>Animals with stings include bees, wasps (including hornets) and scorpions,<br> as well as a single
                beetle species (Onychocerus albitarsis) that can deliver a venomous sting from its antennae,<br> whose
                terminal segments have evolved to resemble a scorpion's tail.</h4>

                        The bee's stinger is an ovipositor. The ovipositor is part of the female bee's reproductive
                        system. The queen bee lays eggs through her ovipositor but can also sting with it. Female worker
                        bees are sterile and do not lay eggs.</p>

                    <p>corpions can sting repeatedly but must have time to replenish their venom. The curved scorpion
                        stinger is found at the end of a scorpion's arched tail, and is used to paralyze and kill any of
                        a scorpion's prey, such as insects and spiders.</p>

                    <p>The mauve stinger is a small jellyfish, but it certainly packs a powerful punch, with long
                        tentacles and warty structures on its ‘bell’ full of stinging cells. Small crustaceans known as
                        amphipods hang out inside the ring of tentacles and are able to survive unharmed.</p>

                    <p>Known for lurking off the coast of Darwin and northern Queensland, <br>the box jellyfish is one
                        of
                        the most potent stingers in Australia. It has been responsible <br>for 70 deaths in the country
                        and
                        takes victims by wrapping its 3m tentacles <br>around the unsuspecting prey. This translucent
                        marine
                        stinger is most prevalent during the summer<br> months and all recorded deaths have occurred
                        between
                        October and May.Venom is injected through small <br>receptors along the tentacles and so the
                        severity of the sting correlates to <br>the amount of the tentacle that touches the skin. <br>In
                        addition to being very painful, the venom attacks the muscles around the lungs and heart. <br>As a
                        result, paralysis of both these organs is the main cause of death in untreated cases.</p>
