 <h1>Insects:</h1>
 <pre id="color"><img src="../images/insect2.jpg"width='200px' height="200px"align='left'>
    (from Latin insectum) are <span>pancrustace.an hexapod invertebrates</span> of the class<strong> Insects</strong>.
    They are the largest group within the<span> arthropod phylum</span>. Insects have a<span> chitinousexoskeleton</span>,
    a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs ofjointed <span>legs</span>,
    n<span> compound eyes</span> and one pair of <span> antennae</span>. Their blood is not totally contained 
    in vessels; some circulates in an open cavity known as the<span> haemocoel</span>. Insects are the most 
    diverse group of animals; they include more than a million described <span>species</span> and represent 
    more than half of all known living <span>organisms.<sup>[1][2]</sup></span> The total number of <span>extant</span>
    species is estimated at between six and ten million;<span><sup>[1][3][4]</sup></span> potentially over 90% of 
    the animal life forms on Earth are insects.<span><sup>[4][5]</sup></span> Insects may  be found in nearly all<span>environments</span>,
    although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, which are dominated by another arthropod group,
    <span>crustaceans</span>, which recent research has indicated insects are nested within.

    Nearly all insects hatch from <span>eggs</span>. Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic <span>exoskeleton</span>
    and development involves a series of <span>molts</span>.
    The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a usually
    immobile<span> pupal</span> stage in those
    groups that undergo<span> four-stage metamorphosis</span>. Insects that undergo<span> three-stage metamorphosis</span>
    lack a pupal stage and adults develop through 
    a series of <span>nymphal</span> stages.<span><sup>[6]</sup></span> The higher level relationship of the <span>insects</span>
    is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found
    from the<span> Paleozoic</span> Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in). The most diverse
    insect groups appearto have coevolved with flowering plants.

<h2>Bees:</h2>

<pre class="sc"><img src="../images/bee.jpg"width="200px"height="200px"align="left" >
    members of the <span>Apidae</span> family,
    are flying insects that collect nectar and pollen.
    There are many different types of bees, possibly 20 000 species,
    and there are many differences between them.
    Some make honey and some don't. Some can sting, while others can't.

    Bees feed on <span>nectar</span> and <span>pollen</span>, the former primarily as an energy source
    and the latter primarily for<span> protein</span> and other nutrients. 
    Most pollen is used as food for their <span>larvae</span>. Vertebrate 
    predators of bees include primates and birds such as bee-eaters;
    insect predators include<span> beewolves</span> and dragonflies.</pre>

<h2>Bug:</h2>

        Bugs, also known as insects, can often be seen as an annoyance to humans,  
        but they play a huge part in our world and 90% of all living things are insects,
        so they’re very important. eat more plants than any animal on earth. They eat dead plants
        and animals and they themselves are a main source of food for many other animals.
        Bugs are useful because they produce honey, wax, silk and other products
        The great outdoors is a place where the sun is shining and the flowers are calling. 
        It’s amazing to spend the day outside basking in the sunshine while reading a book or
    relaxing after a tough week. However, some would prefer to spend their days indoors because
    of insects and<span> bugs</span>. Some are prone to allergies and the common misconceptions that we have
    about them are too overwhelming to ignore. Journey with us as we see these creatures in a 
    different light. Get ready to appreciate and learn more about them now in these really cool
    bug facts.
