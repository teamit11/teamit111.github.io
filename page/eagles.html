                    Eagles are powerful birds of prey heralded for their strength, and <br> have adapted to be one of
                    the most ferocious avian predators. <br> However, the hunters have become the hunted, with many
                    species <br>now at risk of illegal shooting and poisoning.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    There are 68 species of eagle in the family Accipitridae, and species are <br> as an eagle
                    based on their ability to hunt large prey (over 50cm in <br> length) rather than because they are
                    closely
                    related. Eagles can be found on <br> every continent except Antarctica, though most live in Africa
                    and
                    Asia. They are <br> threatened by climate change, hunting, habitat loss, and electrocution from <br>
                    power
                    lines.

                    Eagles are some of the largest birds of prey. The White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla has the
                    largest wingspan at up to 8 feet long, whereas the Steller’s Sea Eagle Haliaeetus pelagicus
                    (Vulnerable) is the heaviest and can weigh up to around 7 kg. Female eagles are typically larger
                    than males of the same species.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eagles are ferocious predators, their size and strength putting them at the top of the food chain.
                    They use their sharp, strong talons to snatch and grasp their prey and tear the flesh with their
                    large hooked beak. Their choice of prey depends on species and includes fish, birds, snakes, or
                    often any medium-sized animal that crosses their path. Their sharp eyesight enables them to spot
                    prey the size of a rabbit around three miles away, before they swoop down, grab their target, and
                    carry it to a perch to eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eagle nests are called eyries and are built in inaccessible places, typically high up on trees or
                    cliffs. They will often re-use the same nest year on year, topping it up with new material when
                    needed, and it can get large enough to cause damage to the tree. Most species lay an average of two
                    eggs and it is not uncommon for the eldest chick to kill the younger to ensure its own survival.
