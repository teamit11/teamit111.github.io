                    under this phylum of which mostly are polychaetes. Annelids have well-developed neuronal and
                    digestive
                    systems and their reproductive strategies include sexual dimorphism.The Annelids are bilaterally
                    symmetrical, triploblastic, coelomate, invertebrate organisms. They also have parapodia for
                    locomotion. Most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes (almost all marine),
                    oligochaetes (which include earthworms) and leech-like species. Cladistic research since 1997 has
                    radically changed this scheme, viewing leeches as a sub-group of oligochaetes and oligochaetes as a
                    sub-group of polychaetes. In addition, the Pogonophora, Echiura and Sipuncula, previously regarded
                    as separate phyla, are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes. Annelids are considered members of
                    the Lophotrochozoa, a "super-phylum" of protostomes that also includes molluscs, brachiopods, and
                    nemerteans.</p>

                    <p>An earthworm is a terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida.<br> They exhibit

                        segmentation;
                        <br>and they usually have setae on all segments. They occur worldwide where soil,<br> water, and
                        temperature

                        Earthworms are commonly found in soil, <br>eating a wide variety of organic matter. This organic
                        matter

            <p>Leeches are segmented parasitic or predatory worms that comprise the subclass Hirudinea within the phylum
                Annelida. They are closely related to the oligochaetes, which include the earthworm, and like them have
                soft, muscular, segmented bodies that can lengthen and contract. Both groups are hermaphrodites and have
                a clitellum, but leeches typically differ from the oligochaetes in having suckers at both ends and in
                having ring markings that do not correspond with their internal segmentation. The body is muscular and
                relatively solid, and the coelom, the spacious body cavity found in other annelids, is reduced to small
                channels.</p>

            Polychaeta is a paraphyletic class of generally marine annelid worms, commonly called
            bristle worms or polychaetes. Each body segment has a pair of fleshy protrusions called
            parapodia that bear many bristles, called chaetae, which are made of chitin. More than 10,000 species are
            described in this class. Common representatives include the lugworm (Arenicola marina) and the sandworm or
            clam worm Alitta.

            Polychaetes as a class are robust and widespread, with species that live in the coldest ocean temperatures
            of the abyssal plain, to forms which tolerate the extremely high temperatures near hydrothermal vents.
            Polychaetes occur throughout the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the
            surface, to a 2- to 3-cm specimen (still unclassified) observed by the robot ocean probe Nereus at the
            bottom of the Challenger Deep, the deepest known spot in the Earth's oceans. Only 168 species (less than
            2% of all polychaetes) are known from fresh waters.
