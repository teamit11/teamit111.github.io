                <h1>Did you ever ask what is a sponge?</h1>
                <p>Sponges — simple aquatic animals with dense, yet porous, skeletons — are highly adapted to their
                    environments.</p>
                <p>
                    Sponges have been around for a very long time, with certain species having a fossil record that
                    dates back approximately 600 million years to the earliest (Precambrian) period of Earth’s history.
                    The approximately 8,550 living sponge species are scientifically classified in the phylum Porifera,
                    which is comprised of four distinct classes: the Demospongiae (the most diverse, containing 90
                    percent of all living sponges), Hexactinellida (the rare glass sponges), Calcarea (calcareous
                    sponges), and Homoscleromorpha (the rarest and simplest class, only recently recognized, with
                    approximately 117 species).

                    Calcarea

                <p>
                    All sponges in this class are strictly marine, and, while they are distributed worldwide, most are
                    found
                    in shallow tropical waters. Like nearly all other sponges, they are sedentary filter feeders.

                    All three sponge body plans are represented within class Calcarea : asconoid, syconoid, and
                    leuconoid.
                    Typically, calcareous sponges are small, measuring less than 10 cm (3.9 in) in height, and drab in
                    colour. However, a few brightly coloured species are also known.

                    Calcareous sponges vary from radially symmetrical vase-shaped body types to colonies made up of a
                    meshwork of thin tubes, or irregular massive forms. The skeleton has either a mesh or honeycomb
                    structure.

                    Hexactinellid sponges are sponges with a skeleton made of four- and/or six-pointed siliceous
                    spicules, often referred to as glass sponges. They are usually classified along with other sponges
                    in the phylum Porifera, but some researchers consider them sufficiently distinct to deserve their
                    own phylum, Symplasma. Some experts believe glass sponges are the longest-lived animals on earth;
                    these scientists tentatively estimate a maximum age of up to 15,000 years.

                <p>
                    Demosponges (Demospongiae) are the most diverse class in the phylum Porifera. They include 76.2% of
                    all species of sponges with nearly 8,800 species worldwide (World Porifera Database).[3] They are
                    sponges with a soft body that covers a hard, often massive skeleton made of calcium carbonate,
                    either aragonite or calcite. They are predominantly leuconoid in structure. Their "skeletons" are
                    made of spicules consisting of fibers of the protein spongin, the mineral silica, or both. Where
                    spicules of silica are present, they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar
                    glass sponges.[4] Some species, in particular from the Antarctic, obtain the silica for spicule
                    building from the ingestion of siliceous diatoms. [5]

                    Homosclerophorida
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homosclerophorida is an order of marine sponges. It is the only order in the monotypic class
                    Homoscleromorpha. The order is composed of two families: Plakinidae and Oscarellidae.
                </p>
                <P>
                    These sponges are massive or encrusting in form and have a very simple structure with very little
                    variation in spicule form (all spicules tend to be very small). Reproduction is viviparous and the
                    larva is an oval form known as an amphiblastula. This form is usual in calcareous sponges but is
                    less common in other sponges.
                    Homoscleromorpha are exclusively marine sponges that tend to encrust on other surfaces at shallow
                    depths. These sponges typically inhabit shady locations, under overhangs and inside caves. In the
                    Mediterranean Sea, 82% of the species in this taxon can be found in caves, and 41% of them are found
                    nowhere else.
