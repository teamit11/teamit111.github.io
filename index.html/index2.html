       <p> Gazelles are thin, graceful antelopes that live in Africa and Asia. 
        They resemble deer and are in the same family as goats, cattle and sheep.
         Gazelles can be identified by their curved, ringed horns, tan or reddish-brown coats and white rumps.
          Often, there are spots or stripes on their coats. 
          Their light frames help make them agile and better able to escape from predators.

        There are 19 species of gazelle, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).
         Smaller species, such as the Speke's gazelle and Thomson's gazelle,
          are only 20 to 43 inches (51 to 109 centimeters) at the shoulder.
          They weigh from 26 to 165 pounds (12 to 75 kilograms).
           The dama gazelle is the largest gazelle.
            It weighs in at 88 to 165 pounds (40 to 75 kg) and is 4.5 to 5.5 feet tall (137 to 168 cm).</p>

        <p>Elephants are the largest existing land animals.
         Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest
          elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean
           family Elephantidae. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; 
           extinct members include the mastodons. Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, 
           including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. 
           African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller
            ears, and convex or level backs.
             The distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks
             , large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for
              breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are 
              derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects
               and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as
                well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight. </p>

Well known for their long necks, these gentle giants are the world’s tallest living land animals.<br /> 
            A giraffe’s height is helpful for keeping a look out for predators, such as lions and hyenas.

        Kangaroos are large marsupials that are found only in Australia. 
        They are identified by their muscular tails, strong back legs, large feet, short fur and long,
         pointed ears. Like all marsupials, a sub-type of mammal, females have pouches that contain mammary
          glands, where their young live until they are old enough to emerge.

Kangaroos are in the Macropodidae family, which also includes tree-kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos,
 quokkas and pademelons. When people think of kangaroos, the four species that typically
  come to mind are in the genus Macropus: the antilopine kangaroo, the red kangaroo, the western gray
   kangaroo and the eastern gray kangaroo. They are sometimes referred to as the "great kangaroos"
    because these species are much larger than other kangaroos</p>

         Like humans, cows (cattle) form close friendships and choose to spend much of their time with 2-4 preferred individuals. They also hold grudges for years and may dislike particular individuals.
        <br />
        
          display emotions and have been shown to produce more milk when they are treated better
              and as individuals.<br />
          get excited when they solve problems.
              When faced with the challenge of trying find out how to open a door to reach food,
               their heartbeats went up, their brainwaves showed excitement, 
               and some even jumped into the air.<br />
         Cows show their excitement when let out into a field after long periods confined indoors.
        <br />
        Cattle like to sleep close to their families, and sleeping arrangements 
    are determined by individuals’ rank in the social hierarchy.<br /></p>

    Sloths are medium-sized mammals that live in the Central and South American rainforests.<br />
The sloth got its name from its slow movement, it is not lazy, just slow-moving. <br />
The sloth is the slowest mammal on Earth.
 In total, there are six species of sloth.<br />
Sloths belong to the families ‘Megalonychidae’ and ‘Bradypodidae’,
 part of the order ‘Pilosa’. Most scientists call these two families the ‘Folivora’
  suborder, while some call it ‘Phyllophaga’.</p>

    Female Tigers are intelligent and strong to the point of domineering.
     To some, they may appear entirely unfeminine. In the workplace, they can appear brash.
      In reality, however, Tigers possess positive traits that spell success both at work and home.
     In the professional setting, Tiger women are bold and decisive.</p>
